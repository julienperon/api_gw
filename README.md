#### Api gateway with cognito in cdk.

The idea of this project is to deploy api gateway
with iam authorizers. The iam authorizers are identified
in cognito. The code is using AWS CDK.  

The dockerfile is in a separate repository. 


TODO: 
- Deploy Cognito
- Deploy an external idp (using SAML, JWT, or OAuth)
- Add End to End tests
